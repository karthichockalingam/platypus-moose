# Source current density for a homogenised stranded coil carrying a specified total current,
# for use by clf_Aformsolve.i and msqlf_Aformsolve.i.
#
# The coil is homogenised over its turns, so the current density has constant magnitude I/S
# across the cross-section, where I is the total current and S the cross-sectional area. The
# direction the current follows around the coil is obtained from the coil geometry alone: the
# electric field solved for below is everywhere tangential to the turns, so e/|e| is the unit
# vector following them, and the current density is
#
#   J = (I / S) e / |e|.
#
# S is measured as the flux of e/|e| through the cut surface, so no calibration constant relating
# the loop voltage to the total current is needed, and the loop voltage below only sets the sense
# in which the current circulates. Reversing its sign reverses e and S together, leaving J
# unchanged; the circulation direction is fixed by the orientation of the cut surface.
